Hello! I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at the [University of Florida](https://mse.ufl.edu/) under the advisement of [Prof. Simon R. Phillpot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nK2OtUkAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is focused on atomistic modeling using techniques such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics to solve interesting problems in the realms of steel alloy corrosion, radionuclide sequestration, and high entropy Li-oxide battery materials.

I'm also deeply interested in machine learning methods and their application to the vast amounts of untapped data constantly being produced by chemists, physicists, and biologists.

In my free time you can find me hacking away at my personal programming projects, getting my hands dirty restoring a vintage motorcycle, or gaming late into the night with my friends on Discord.
